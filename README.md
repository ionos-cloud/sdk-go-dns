# DNSaaS

## Overview
DNS as a Service (DNSaaS) allows users to publish DNS Zones of their domains and subdomains on public Name Servers.

IONOS Name Server Infrastructure is distributed across 14 point-of-presence (POP) locations in Europe and U.S.A. to ensure fast and reliable DNS resolution for users wherever they are located.

With DNS as a Service (DNSaaS), you can manage your DNS Zones and Records programmatically via API.
